STC beta plan


Backlog:
	0. Contact mod authors
	1. Exact version numbers of texture packs used -> /u/neversleeps84
	2. Add mod author names/copyright
	3. Links to packs
	4. Thumbnails instead of select list
	5. Domain
	6. Layout stuff (fullscreen option, mobile, etc)
	7. Support for multiple comparison types? (e.g. weather, meshes)
	8. Organization/representation of images:
		Use of tags to classify images: "interior", "farm", "night", "sweetroll"
	9. TRIPLE COMPARISONS????

	Aand the big one:
	10. User contribution
		Options:
			1. Users send their albums via Dropbox etc, I add them. Simple. But also boring.
			2. Users can upload albums with a fixed number of images directly to the site.
				There would be a standard set of locations & camera angles. Uploaded images must be named 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.
				The album can either represent a texture pack that is not yet on the site or a different version of an existing one.

				User input needed:
					Name, new or existing texture pack?, author, link, version, folder

				Requirements:
					Upload page
					File management
					Persistence
					UI update
					Security

				Community input needed:
					Maybe a group of texture mod authors/texture connaisseurs (whatever that means) could agree on a set of suitable locations (good mix of textures, close-up and distant shots, etc)
					Should there be some kind of default graphic settings? I'm not thinking every single slider has to be at the right value, but there should be a common resolution, FOV (obviously), ... what else?
					IMO there are two ways comparability can be ensured:
						1. Use of savegames -> /u/neversleeps84
						2. Mod for easily taking screenshots:
							I think this should be possible: add a book/spell/idontknow (MCM WE NEED YOU) that teleports the player to predefined locations and sets their viewing angle.
							~ 30 shots, fixed time of day/weather, fixed camera angle


	Aaaaaaand the really big one:
	11. We need a snazzy name.
